# leetcode_problems

This repository contains the problems that I solved in the leetcode website.

Filenames are started with the Problem number in the leetcode website. Each file contains the problem description is it appears in the leetcode.

Many of them are not the optimal and best solution. I learned a lot from when I first started solving problems. Maybe now I can improve some of my early solutions but they are remained as it is.
